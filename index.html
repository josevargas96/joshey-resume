            <p>There's this idea that one should fit their resume in just one page. Trying to fit your experience, your skills, and the different ways you can bring impact to a company in just one page sounds like a recipe to leave key things out. <em>So I created a website ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</em> I don't only want to show you my career accomplishments but also give you a glimpse of what my personality is like‚Äîplus this is a more creative way to navigate ATS tools‚Ä¶ <br> 
                Working in product management for the last 3 years has not only helped me build a strong foundation in technology and user-centered design but also opened my eyes to my real passion: <strong>solving real-world problems</strong>. The experience I've gained leading cross-functional teams and optimizing processes has taught me the ins and outs of roadmap prioritization and how to deliver solutions that drive real impact. <br>
                I'm still early in my career with a lot to learn, but I'm confident my strong technical foundation, eagerness to gain more experience, and passion for solving problems will help me create products that make a real difference in people's lives. Moreover, I'm always excited to connect with teams that share my passion for impactful product development!

                    <p class="role-description">My time as a Product Product Manager has been filled with learning experiences and achievements that shaped my product management foundation. Here are some highlights I'm particularly proud of:</p>
                    <ul class="achievements">
                        <li>Leading the rollout of a Provider Recommendation Service was definitely one of my biggest wins. Not only did it reduce costs by $150,000 annually, but it also boosted revenue by 5%‚Äîadding an extra $5.7M to our annual revenue.</li>
                        <li>Our team was known as the problem solver squad. I dove deep into customer journeys and process flows using Miro and other collaboration tools, turning those insights into solutions that actually made a difference. There's something really satisfying about seeing customer pain points transform into effective product solutions.</li>
                        <li>I owned and managed quite a portfolio: 5 web applications spread across customer-facing, partner-facing, and internal tools. These apps were powered by 50+ backend/frontend services, using API integrations and asynchronous messaging architecture. Making sure data flowed smoothly between these services and Salesforce was crucial‚Äîand sometimes challenging!</li>
                        <li>Managing these applications meant developing and maintaining their product roadmaps. I kept a steady stream of improvements and new features flowing, always making sure they aligned with our company strategy. The key was prioritizing based on impact and business goals, which taught me a lot about strategic decision-making.</li>
                        <li>Another achievement that really stands out was improving how our teams worked together across 3 countries and 5 time zones (with up to 8 hours of difference!). I established clear communication practices that reduced downtime and made our developers happier. It really showed me how crucial good communication is when working with global teams.</li>

                    <p class="role-description">Moving into my role as an Associate Product Manager was a game-changer‚Äîthis was my first 'pure' product management position, and it landed me right in the middle of our FinOps team.</p>
                    <ul class="achievements">
                        <li>The highlight of my time here? Without a doubt, it was leading the development of a unified payment platform that integrated multiple payment providers' APIs. Not only did this project improve our EBITDA by over $200,000 annually, but we also achieved an impressive 95% user adoption rate. This was the project that really propelled my career to the next level.</li>
                        <li>Building this payment platform was like getting a crash course in modern tech architecture. I got my hands dirty with APIs and microservices, while learning to lead cross-functional teams. Breaking down complex requirements into achievable sprints taught me the real value of agile methodologies‚Äîthere's nothing quite like seeing a massive project come together sprint by sprint.</li>
                        <li>And then there were the stakeholders‚Äîso many stakeholders! Managing relationships across different departments taught me the art of clear communication and the importance of keeping everyone aligned. Balancing technical implementation with business objectives was challenging, but it showed me how crucial it is to speak both languages fluently in product management.</li>

                        <li>I'm particularly proud of how I managed to reduce ERP issue resolution time from several days to just 1-2 days by developing strong troubleshooting skills and streamlining communication with our development team. Turning user frustrations into quick solutions became my specialty.</li>
                        <li>As I grew more comfortable with the technical aspects, I found myself naturally gravitating toward product work. I started helping our product manager gather requirements from different business units and collaborated with cross-functional teams to bring new features to life in Microsoft Dynamics NAV.</li>
                        <li>As the bridge between our US ERP users and our development team in Berlin, I learned the art of translating user needs into technical solutions across time zones and cultures. This experience laid the foundation for my future in product management.</li>
